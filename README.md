# LoE Realm (Chicago's Server)
This is the source code used on Chicago's server of LoE Realm within 2015.

## About server source:
This project is based on Phoenix Realms (https://github.com/RoxyLalonde/Phoenix-Realms) and Nilly's Realm Phoenix (https://github.com/Devwarlt/nillys-realm-phoenix).

I didn't developed this server source, just modified few things to make game like what I planned to be.
